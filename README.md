# cooking-baking
I really enjoy baking and cooking. I have been baking since I was around ten years old. My favorite thing to bake used to be chocolate cupcakes but now I enjoy making chocolate chip cookies. As I have grown older I now enjoy cooking. When I cook I like to make complicated dishes or dishes that come from different cultures then my own. One of my favorite dishes that I enjoy making is a mushroom pizza. For the mushroom pizza, I will use a giant portabello mushroom and clean it. After its all clean I will start to assemble it with the usual suspects of pizza sauce and cheese. After I take it out the oven wait ten minutes and then enjoy!
